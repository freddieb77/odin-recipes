        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 (7.25 ounce) packages macaroni and cheese</li>
                <li>1 pound extra-lean ground beef</li>
                <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn, undrained</li>
                <li>1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the macaroni is cooking, brown ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>
                <li>Drain macaroni; do not rinse. Return to the pot and add butter, milk, and both packages of cheese sauce mix. Stir until well combined.</li>
                <li>Combine macaroni and cheese, ground beef mixture, undrained corn, tomato sauce, and tomato paste in a 2-quart casserole dish; mix well.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ol>
